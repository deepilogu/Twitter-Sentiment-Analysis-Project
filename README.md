# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
The Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project aims to analyze the sentiments of tweets on the social networking website Twitter. The project utilizes a dataset consisting of 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the Twitter API. Each tweet in the dataset is labeled with a sentiment (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive).

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following 6 fields:
1. **target**: The polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive)
2. **ids**: The ID of the tweet
3. **date**: The date of the tweet (in the format Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)
4. **flag**: The query. If there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.
5. **user**: The user that tweeted
6. **text**: The text of the tweet

## Objective
The main objective of the project is to design a classification model that can accurately predict the polarity (sentiment) of tweets provided in the dataset.

## Steps to Execute the Project
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset can be obtained by scraping tweets from provided Twitter dataset .
2. **Data Preprocessing**: This step involves cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis. Tasks may include removing duplicates, handling missing values, and preprocessing text data (e.g., tokenization, removing stopwords, stemming, etc.).
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of sentiments, analyze the relationship between different features, and identify any patterns or trends.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the dataset or create new features that may improve the performance of the classification model.
5. **Model Building**: Build and train classification models using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, etc.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.).
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the best-performing model to optimize its performance.
8. **Deployment**: Deploy the final model for real-world use, if applicable.
